## Stack technology
The basis of the application functionality implementation is the programming language **C#**, one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.

Software technologies such as **HTML5**, **CSS3**and **JavaScript*are used to describe the user interface and data transfer within the client. 

It is believed that **ASP.NET Core** is a powerful tool for fast web application creation, which is included in almost all known versions of the Microsoft platform. NET Framework.

**Entity**. The essence of the Entity Framework is that it is a set of technologies that can support the development of data-oriented software applications. This is an object-relational mapping (ORM) platform with open source in ADO.NET. This is part of the . NET Framework.

**Identity Framework**. Using this framework, the developer has access to the most powerful tool to work with authorization and registration. It contains a huge number of implementable methods that simplify and optimize work. One ASP.NET identification system. ASP.NET identity can be used with all ASP.NET platforms such as ASP.NET MVC, Web forms, Web pages, Web APIs, and SignalR.

## Termination of architecture
The design pattern **MVC**(Model - View - Controller) is the basic, basic design pattern. It is a scheme to separate application data, user interface and control logic into three separate components: model, representation, and controller - so that each component can be modified independently.

The structure of this project was realized by internal division into 7 applications, each of which performs its functions:

   **Controllers, Helpers, Interfaces, Migrations, Models, Repository, Services, ViewModels и Views**
